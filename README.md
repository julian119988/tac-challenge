# Anti-Procrastination Focus App

## The Application

A browser-based anti-procrastination/meme app that helps you stay focused by detecting when you're distracted. The app uses your device's camera to track where you're looking in real-time. When it detects you're looking at your phone or away from the screen, it automatically plays an attention-grabbing video to bring you back on task.

**Key Features:**
- Browser-based application with camera access
- Real-time gaze detection and face tracking
- Automatic distraction detection (looking at phone, looking away)
- Attention-grabbing video playback as intervention
- Fun, meme-inspired approach to productivity

## Development Approach: Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC)

This project is being developed using **Tactical Agentic Coding (TAC)** - a new paradigm where we template our engineering patterns and teach AI agents how to operate our codebase instead of directly writing all code ourselves. This allows us to scale compute to scale our impact.

The Agentic Layer wraps the Application Layer, providing a programmatic interface for AI-driven development workflows.

## Two Approaches to the Agentic Layer

### 1. Minimum Viable Agentic Layer

The simplest implementation to get started with agentic coding:

```
specs/                          # Plans for agents to follow
├── *.md                        # Implementation specifications

.claude/commands/               # Agentic prompts
├── chore.md                    # Planning template
├── implement.md                # Implementation template
└── *.md                        # Other slash commands

adws/                           # AI Developer Workflows
├── adw_modules/
│   └── agent.py                # Core agent execution
└── adw_*.py                    # Top-level workflow scripts (uv single-file)
```

**Key Components:**
- **Plans** (`specs/`): Structured specifications that guide agent actions
- **Prompts** (`.claude/commands/`): Reusable templates for agent interactions
- **Workflows** (`adws/`): Executable scripts that orchestrate agents

### 2. Scaled Agentic Layer

A fully-featured implementation for production-grade agentic development:

```

```

**Advanced Components:**
- **Types** (`adw_modules/data_types.py`): Strong typing for agent interactions
- **Triggers** (`adw_triggers/`): Multiple invocation patterns (manual, cron, webhooks)
- **Testing** (`adw_tests/`): Validate agent behavior
- **Observability** (`agents/`): Comprehensive logging and debugging
- **Isolation** (`trees/`): Dedicated worktrees for safe agent operations
- **Hooks** (`.claude/hooks/`): Event-driven automation and guardrails

## Flexibility Note

This is just *one way* to organize the agentic layer. The key principle is creating a structured environment where:
- Engineering patterns are templated and reusable
- Agents have clear instructions on how to operate the codebase
- Workflows are composable and scalable
- Output is observable and debuggable

Feel free to adapt this structure to your specific needs and workflows.

## Codebase Structure

### Agentic Layer

The agent layer contains the functionality responsible for agentic coding.
This is where you template your engineering and teach agents how to operate your codebase.

### Application Layer

The application layer contains your actual application code.
This is what your agents will operate on.

`apps/` - Your application code
